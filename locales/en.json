By coordinating with conferences held in Japan and overseas, facilitating exchanges between users, and helping to spread and enlighten Python and related software, more interest has been gathered in Python, and many users and software have been attracted. I believe that being born will be our driving force. <br> <br> PyCon JP 2019 The theme for this year is Python New Era. The new era in Japan. Python also has the concept of moving from 2 to 3 into a new era. <br> <br> PyCon JP 2019 will be held with the goal of a conference where everyone can enjoy new connections and knowledge.",
